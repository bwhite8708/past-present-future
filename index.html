<h2>Past</h2>
<p>I was born in Chicago Illinois but then moved to California ,Savannah Georgia ,then Greenville south Carolina .</p>

<h2>Present:</h2>
<p>I currently attend J.L Mann High School .This is my sophomore year.I like this school it's just some of their sports teams suck a little bit.Right now i'm planning to finish high school and after my senior year start my rapping and my own clothing line.</p>

<p>Im just getting a feel of how to make beats and freestyling to beats my God Brother and cousin make.My dad and Mom support me in my rapping but my grandmother is a little worried about me doing it.i've lived with my grandmother and great-grandmother since i was a baby bc my dad was in and out of prison and my mom was going through some things and i'm my grandmother's oldest grandson and i think me being and living with her has had a big impact bc she is very overprotective of me.My dad has been in my life more ,i go with him every friday and stay the weekend and have a lot of fun.</p>

<h2>Future</h2>

<p>My Future Plan is to become the next big name in the Rap Game and to have my own fashion line.Me and my bros plan to move to LA when we get on our feet and get deep into rapping.
My Brother Javious raps
Big Cam Is My Producer
My Cousin Kalani is my clothing And logo designer
My bro triquan is going to be my hype man when we start touring and doing parties and other things.
Me and all my bros made our own click or squad Call FBF (Family Before Fame) and BBF(Bros Before Females) which basically means bros and family come before females and Fame.We have our own hand shakes and we all wear black ,white,or purple when we go out places.My mom though it was our gang but it's nothing like a gang it's just a bunch of us that are very close and we all trust each other.</p>
